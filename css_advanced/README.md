Features
Semantic HTML5: Built with a strong emphasis on semantic HTML elements (<header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <footer>) for better accessibility and SEO.

Clear Navigation: An intuitive navigation bar allowing users to jump to different sections of the page (Introduction, Projects, About Me, Contact).

Introduction Section: A brief self-description to welcome visitors.

Projects Section: Dedicated area to highlight coding projects, each with a title, description, and link to the project (or its code repository).

About Me Section: Detailed information about my background, technical skills, and what drives my passion for development.

Contact Section: Provides clear ways for visitors to get in touch, including email, LinkedIn, and GitHub links.

Responsive Design Principles: While core styling is handled separately, the HTML is structured to easily adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Custom Styling (CSS Integration): Designed to integrate with external CSS files for a unique and professional look, adhering to design principles (colors, typography, layout).

Interactive Elements: Includes clickable links and potentially embedded content (like project images or conceptual links).

Branding: Incorporates a simple logo (unicode character) in the navigation for personal branding.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the webpage content.

CSS3: For styling and layout.

Git & GitHub: For version control and project hosting.
